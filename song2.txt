I stay up too late, got nothin' in my brain
That's what people say, mmm-mmm, that's what people say, mmm-mmm
I go on too many dates (chuckles), but I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, mmm-mmm, that's what people say, mmm-mmm

But I keep cruisin', can't stop, won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music in my mind sayin' it's gonna be alright

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

I never miss a beat, I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm, that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
I'm dancin' on my own (dancin' on my own), I make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm, that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I, I, I shake it off (you've got to)
Shake it off, I, I, I shake it off (you've got to)

'Cause the players gonna play play play play play
And the haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate haters gonna hate
I'm just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
I shake it off I shake it off

Shake it off, I, I, I shake it off
Shake it off, I, I, I shake it off
Shake it off, I, I, I shake it off
Shake it off, I, I, I shake it off
Shake it off, I, I, I shake it off
Shake it off, I, I, I shake it off
Shake it off, I, I, I shake it off
Shake it off, I, I, I shake it off, I, I, I shake it off
